#Overview
This repo contains code and data for forecasting the US 2020 presidential election. It was created by Brian Diep, John Cao, Jonathan Tillmann, and Tanya Ws. The purpose is to create a report that summarises the results of a statistical model that we built. Some data is unable to be shared publicly and we detail how to obtain it below. The sections of this repo are: input, output, scripts.

Inputs contain data that are unchanged from their original source. We use two datasets to build our model:

- [Survey data - Tanya detail how you got the survey data]
- [ACS data - Brian detail how you got the ACS data]

Outputs contain data that are modified from the input data, the report, and supporting material.

-X,
-Y

Scripts contain R scripts that take inputs and outputs and produce outputs. These are: 

-01-data_cleaning-survey.R
-01-data_cleaning-post-strat.R
